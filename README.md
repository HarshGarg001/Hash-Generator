## Hash Generator

### Description
This Python script generates hash values for given input text using various hashing algorithms. It supports popular algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512.

### Usage
1. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script.
2. **Input text:** Enter the text you want to hash.
3. **Select algorithm:** Choose the desired hashing algorithm from the available options.
4. **Output:** The script will display the generated hash value.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* hashlib library

### Example
```
Enter the text: Hello, world!
Select algorithm (MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512): SHA256

Hash: 2489006e4f39f2d3f636b0374d0d958243fc8302bb3f8302ca93c114d65c3265
```

### Additional Notes
* Hashing is a one-way process. It's not possible to recover the original text from a hash value.
* For cryptographic purposes, it's recommended to use stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or higher.
* MD5 is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities.

**Use this tool responsibly.**

**Optional:**
* Provide information about the specific use cases for the hash generator.
* Include details about the implementation of the hashing algorithms.
* Add a license to your project.
* Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs.
